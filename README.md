# Automating-Data-Insights-with-Alteryx-Rootbeer-Analysis

In this project, I imported 9 tables into Alteryx Designer to prepare, manipulate, and analyze data, gaining a deeper understanding of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. Key tasks included identifying and correcting data errors, joining data from multiple sources, and calculating new metrics and dimensions.

Additionally, I created data visualizations to analyze insights and generated reports to effectively communicate the findings to stakeholders. This project enhanced my ability to automate and streamline complex data workflows in Alteryx.
